<p>
Austin and Travis Countyâ€™s Continuum of Care (CoC) has gathered the data presented in this dashboard. A Continuum of Care is a regional group of non-profit organizations that provide services to the population experiencing homelessness.
</p>
<p>
While there is a wide range of organizations that serve Austin's homeless community, this dashboard only represents data gathered by certain members of the Continuum of Care. This dashboard does not include data from organizations whose collection methods are incompatible with the larger group. This dashboard also does not include data gathered outside the Continuum of Care. 
</p>
<p>
There are people experiencing homelessness who choose not to seek services from the CoC. This data does not include those individuals.
</p>
<h1>Data Discrepancies
</h1>
<p>
Because of the nature of homelessness case work, data entry can be incomplete or imperfect, and sometimes data changes after it is reported. The data featured in this dashboard is a snapshot of the issue of homelessness in Austin, but it is not comprehensive.
</p>
<p>
The Continuum of Care is currently analyzing 2019 data, and there are some metrics that still need to be updated. Data visualized in the dashboard will change as more current data becomes available.
